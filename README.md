# Walkie-Talkie

A walkie-talkie Flutter project for learning purpose. Now, you don't have to call/yell your folks' name. Just scan your network, locate their device and send your voice message (which will not be stored!)

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application. It is primarily targetted for Android devices (min Sdk Version = 23)

## What is it?

In you private WiFi network, now you can install this app and all devices with this app will be able to discover each other.

Press and hold to record, and release to send.
